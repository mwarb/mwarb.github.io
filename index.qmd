## About me

Following an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering (2012 - 2016), I completed a PhD in Psychology (2019 - 2024), and currently work as a Research Officer at the University of Leeds (2022 - Present).

My research interests include how we learn and maintain sensorimotor skills, how motor and cognitive abilities interact, and how early life factors influence learning trajectories. I have researched these areas using a variety of methods, including online experiments, virtual reality, and secondary data.
